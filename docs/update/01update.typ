== General

- Task distribution in first group session
- Repository creation, Python setup
- Research and familiarization into the Topic


== Overview

Who does what?

== Supervisor
*What was done?*

- First experiments with langchain/langgraph
- Experimental langchain supervisor with dynamic tooling


*What questions are there?*

- Gemma3 seems to have no tooling support.
  - Is this known? There are hacks to work around this.
  - Can an alternative model like llama3.1 be used instead?

- Tools as Tools or as Nodes?
  - What are your experiences?

*Plan for the next two weeks*
- Connect first MCP server mocks
- Decision for a Langgraph design approach
- Document Provider
\
\
*TODOs*
- Couple counseling for Jan + Felix

== Document Class Detector

*What has been done?*

- Setup ML Infrastructure:
  - PyTorch Lightning Module
    - `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`
    - `torchmetrics.Accuracy` & `torchmetrics.ConfusionMatrix`
    - setup logging, custom TQDM progress bar
  - Config Handling using Pydantic with _ConfigAsFactory_ design pattern.
  - Augmentation Pipeline using Albumentations
  - Optuna and WandB Integration for Hyperparameter Tuning and Experiment Tracking
