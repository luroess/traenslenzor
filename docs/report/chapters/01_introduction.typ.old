== Supervisor

Einstein's famous equation relates energy and mass:

$ E = m c^2 $ <eq:einstein>

Equation @eq:einstein demonstrates the relation between energy and mass (see also @einstein1905).

== Image Provider

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Describe the image sources, formats, and any preprocessing (e.g., cropping, DPI normalization).
]

== Layout Detector

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Describe detection targets (text blocks, figures, tables), model/heuristics, inputs/outputs, and metrics.
]

== Font Detector

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Summarize classes, training data, features, model, and inference output.
  Include experiment results (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy per class, example errors).
]

== Document Class Detector

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Define classes (report, homework, proposal, essay, slides, …), inputs/features, and decision logic.
  Add evaluation (precision/recall, ROC, confusion matrix).
]

== Document Translator

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Explain translation steps, language support, glossaries, and quality assurance.
]

== Document Image Renderer

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Describe rendering pipeline (fonts, pagination, resolution, export formats) and performance considerations.
]

== X

#box(fill: luma(240), inset: 8pt, radius: 6pt)[
  Placeholder for an additional component. Describe task, I/O, method, and key detail.
